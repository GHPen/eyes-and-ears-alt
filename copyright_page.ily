      The ways in which the Clairnote version differs from the original version include the following.
      The Clairnote version has no footnotes, no index (by title and composer), and no indications that a melody is famous.
      The thematic index only includes melody numbers (not page numbers).
      Sections of chapters do not automatically start on a new page.
      A few sentences that were not relevant to Clairnote music notation have been omitted from the introduction to chapter six (The C Clef).
